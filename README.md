# 🤓 Algorithms

## 📝 General info
The repository serves as a container for the algorithms that I mostly wrote during my studies, there will also be algorithms written for personal projects, most of them can probably be found online, but hey... one repository to have all of them in one place sounds nice. <b>Feel free to use</b> ✌
